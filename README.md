# Reinvent Coaching Process â€“ WordPress Plugin

A professional WordPress plugin for guiding users through the Reinvent Coaching Process, inspired by the Hero's Journey and Super Self frameworks. The plugin presents a series of reflective questions, explanations, and input fields to help users document, edit, and analyze their personal reinvention journeys.

The app will ask the user about themselves:

- ask the user what they want next in life

- ask the user what skills they have, what projects interest them, what their attention is on, what they are drawn to, what they want to learn

- ask the users about past times they reinvented themselves, or had a massive change in life. Go through each of the coaching questions, for each element of that reinvention

- analyze the user's personality type, motivators, what they avoid, what learning style they have,

- analyze the progression in their life, how each reinvention got them to the start of the next reinvention, leading them to where they are today

- Taking everything the user has said, select 5 to 20 ways they could reinvent themselves now, consistent with who they are now, that would increase their financial, business, health, relationship, community, as many aspects of their life as possible.

## Features

- Interactive questionnaire with explanations for each step of the reinvention process

- Supports multiple reinvention journeys per user (each as a database record)

- Save, retrieve, and edit answers at any time

- Clean, accessible UI for large text input fields

- Integration-ready for future AI-powered analysis and insights

- Built using PHP, WordPress API, and follows Model-Service-View-Controller (MSVC) architecture

- Fully unit tested with PHPUnit and custom test framework
